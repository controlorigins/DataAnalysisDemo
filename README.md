# Data Analytics Demonstration
Data Analytics Demonstration is a web application developed by Control Origins that showcases what can be done with a CSV file and some charting and pivoting javascript. The application allows users to select from a list of CSV files, and once a CSV file is selected, it provides some basic analysis such as the number of columns, minimum and maximum values, unique values, most common value, least common value, number of rows, and index position for each column.
